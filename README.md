## This repository provides the matlab code used to derive the constitutive equations in ARMA2021 conference paper. 
### cauchy_hydro.m: get the expression for the cauchy stress with respect to the engineering strain for the hydrostatic loading
### cauchy_uni.m: get the expression for the cauchy stress with respect to the engineering strain for the uniaxial loading
